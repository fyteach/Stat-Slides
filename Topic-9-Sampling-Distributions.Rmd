## Learning Goals

- Demonstrate understanding of the sampling distribution of a statistic.

- Explain how the central limit theorem applies in inference.

- Determine whether a sampling distribution is approximately a normal distribution.

- Calculate key characteristics (mean, standard error) of the sampling distribution of a statistic.

- Estimate the probability of an event using the sampling distribution.

---

## Sampling Distribution

- When using sample statistics to estimate population parameter, there will be a chance error
  $$\text{Population Parameter}=\text{Sample Statistic}+\text{Chance Error}.$$

- To understand the chance error, we need to know how sample statistics distribute. Consider samples of the same size $n$ randomly chosen from the population with replacement.

- The probability distribution of a sample statistic is called a **sampling distribution**.

## Sample Size Affects Standard Error

- The sampling distribution varies as the sample size changes. In general, A larger sample size will result a smaller standard deviation of the sampling distribution.

- The standard deviation of a sampling distribution is also called the **standard error**.

## Central Limit Theorem for Mean

::: {.theorem title="The Central Limit Theorem for Mean"}

As the sample size $n$ increases, the sampling distribution of the sample mean, from a population with the mean $\mu$ and the standard deviation $\sigma$, will approach to a normal distribution with the mean $\mu_{\bar{X}}=\mu$ and the standard deviation $\sigma_{\bar{X}}=\dfrac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}}$.
:::

::: {.remark}
In terms of standardization, the central limit theorem says that the random variable $\bar{Z}=\dfrac{\bar{x}-\mu}{\sigma/\sqrt{n}}$ has an approximately standard normal distribution.

## Required Sample Size for Mean

- For most distributions (not highly skewed), when sample size $n>30$, the sampling distribution of the sample mean $\bar{X}$ can be approximated reasonably well by a normal distribution. The larger the sample size, the better the approximation will be.

- When the population is normally distributed, the sampling distribution of the sample means will be normally distributed for any sample size.

- If the population distribution is highly skewed, relying on CLT can be risky.

## Example: Sampling Distribution of Small Data (1 of 2)

Randomly draw samples of size 2 with replacement from the numbers 1, 3, 4.

- List all possible samples and calculate the mean of each sample.
- Find the mean, and standard deviation of the sample means.
- Find the mean, and standard deviation of the population.

**Solution:** Using the Excel function `AVERAGE()`, we may find means of samples and means of sample means.

Using the Excel function `STDEV.P()`, we may find the standard deviation of the population and the standard deviation of sample means.

## Example: Mean Length of Time on Hold
<!--# style="font-size:0.95em;"-->

Suppose the mean length of time that a caller is placed on hold when telephoning a customer service center is 23.8 seconds, with standard deviation 4.6 seconds. Find the probability that the mean length of time on hold in a random sample of 1,000 calls will be within 0.5 second of the population mean.

**Solution:** Since the sample size $n=1000>30$ is large enough, by the Central Limit Theorem, we know that the mean length of time is approximately normally distributed.

- The mean of the sampling distribution is $\mu_{\bar{X}}=\mu=23.8$.
- The standard deviation of the sampling distribution is $\mu_{\bar{X}}=\dfrac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}}=\dfrac{4.6}{\sqrt{1000}}$.
- Then the probability is $P(23.8-0.5<\bar{X}<23.8+0.5) = P(\bar{X}<24.3)-P(\bar{X}<23.3) \approx 0.9994$ which can be obtained by the following Excel formula:
  `NORM.DIST(24.3, 23.8, 4.6/SQRT(1000),TRUE)-NORM.DIST(23.3, 23.8, 4.6/SQRT(1000),TRUE)`

## Example: Normal vs Sampling Distribution
<!--# style="font-size:0.91em;"-->

Suppose speeds of vehicles on a particular stretch of roadway are normally distributed with mean 36.6 mph and standard deviation 1.7 mph.

- Find the probability that the speed $X$ of a randomly selected vehicle is between 35 and 40 mph.
- Find the probability that the mean speed $\bar{X}$ of 10 randomly selected vehicles is between 35 and 40 mph.

**Solution:** Since the population is normally distributed $\mu=36.6$ and $\sigma=1.7$, the sampling distribution of the sample mean is also normal distributed but with $\mu_{\bar{x}}=\mu=36.6$ and $\sigma_{\bar{X}}=\sigma/\sqrt{n}=1.7/\sqrt{10}$.

- The probability that the speed of a vehicle is between 35 and 40 is $P(35< X< 40)=P(X< 40)-P(X<35)\approx 0.8039$ which can be obtained by
  `NORM.DIST(40, 36.6, 1.7, TRUE)-NORM.DIST(35, 36.6, 1.7, TRUE)`.

- The probability getting a sample of size 10 with the mean between 35 and 40 is $P(35<\bar{X}< 40)=P(\bar{X}< 40)-P(\bar{X}<35)\approx 0.9985$ which can be obtained by
  `NORM.DIST(40, 36.6, 1.7/SQRT(10), TRUE)-NORM.DIST(35, 36.6, 1.7/SQRT(10), TRUE)`

## Sampling Distribution of a Sample Proportion

- The proportion of a specific characteristic in a data set can be viewed as the mean of the data set by identifying the specific characteristic with 1 and others with $0$.

  **Example:** Consider the following data set
  <p style="text-align: center;">
  <span class="red">1</span>, 0, <span class="red">1</span>, <span class="red">1</span>, 0, 0, <span class="red">1</span>, 0, <span class="red">1</span>, <span class="red">1</span>
  </p>
  
  The proportion of <span class="red">red numbers</span> is $\frac{6}{10}=0.6$ which is the same as the mean of the data set: $\frac{6\cdot 1 + 4\cdot 0}{10}=0.6$.

- Consider a population consisting of 1s and 0s. Let $p$ be the proportion of 1s. Then standard deviation is
  $$\sigma=\sqrt{(1-p)^2p+(0-p)^2(1-p)}=\sqrt{p(1-p)}.$$

---

## Central Limit Theorem for Proportion

For a sampling distribution of sample proportion, we write $\hat{P}$ for the random variable of sample proportions.

::: {.theorem title="Central Limit Theorem for Proportion"}

For large samples, the distribution of sample proportions $\hat{P}$ is approximately normal, with the mean $\mu_{\hat{P}}=p$ and standard deviation $\sigma_{\hat{P}}=\sqrt{\frac{p(1-p)}{n}}$, where $p$ is the population proportion.
:::

---

## Required Sample Size for Proportion

- As a sample proportion is always between 0 and 1, and 99.7% of sample proportions lie within 3 standard deviation away from the population proportion, when using the central limit theorem for proportion, we require the sample size $n$ satisfying the following condition: the interval $\left[p-3\sqrt{\frac{p(1-p)}{n}}, p+3\sqrt{\frac{p(1-p)}{n}}\right]$ lies wholly in the interval $[0, 1]$.

- In practice, if $n$ satisfies the following two inequalities: $np\ge 10$ and $n(1-p)\ge 10$, then we consider $n$ is large enough for assuming that the sampling distribution of the sample proportion is approximately normal.

- When the population proportion $p$ is unknown, to apply the central limit theorem for proportion, we require the sample size $n$ satisfying the same conditions with $p$ replaced by the sample proportion $\hat{p}$. That is, the sample size $n$ should satisfies $n\hat{p}\ge 10$ and $n(1-\hat{p})\ge 10$.

## Example: Sampling Voters

Suppose that in a population of voters in a certain region 53% are in favor of a particular law. Nine hundred randomly selected voters are asked if they favor the law.

Find the probability that the sample proportion computed from a random sample of size 900 will be at least 2% above true population proportion.

**Solution:** We first verify that the sampling distribution is approximately normal.

Since $p=0.53$ and $n=900$, $np=900\cdot 0.53>10$ and $n(1-p)=900(1-0.53)>10$. By the central limit theorem, the sampling distribution is approximately normal.

The standard deviation of the sampling distribution is $\sigma_{\hat{P}}=\sqrt{\frac{0.53(1-0.53)}{900}}\approx 0.017$.

Then the probability that the random sample has a proportion at least 2% above 53% is
$P(\hat{P}>0.55)=1-P(\hat{P}\le 0.55)\approx 0.1197$
which can be obtained by
`1-NORM.DIST(0.55, 0.53, SQRT(0.53*(1-0.53)/900),TRUE)`.

## Example: Traffic Accidents

Suppose that in 36% of all car accidents involve injury. Find the probability that the injury rate in a random sample of 250 car accidents is between 30% and 45%.

**Solution:** The injury rate of all car accidents is $p=36\%=0.36$ and the sample size is $250$. Because $np=250\cdot 0.36=`r 250*0.36`>10$ and $n(1-p)=250-`r 250*0.36`=`r 250*(1-0.36)`>10$, the sample size is considered large enough. By the Central Limit Theorem, the sample proportion $\hat{P}$ is approximately normally distributed with the mean $\mu_{\hat{P}}=p=0.36$ and standard deviation $\sigma_{\hat{P}}=\sqrt{\frac{p(1-p)}{n}}\approx `r sigma<-round(sqrt(0.36*(1-0.36)/250),3); sigma`$

Then the probability of a random sample of 250 car accidents with the injury rate between 30% and 45% is
$\textstyle P(0.30<\hat{P}<0.45)=P(\hat{P}<0.45)-P(\hat{P}<0.30)=$ ``=NORM.DIST(30%, 36%,`r sigma`)-NORM.DIST(45%, 36%,`r sigma`)`` $\approx `r p1<-round(pnorm(0.45, 0.36, sigma), 3); p2<-round(pnorm(0.30, 0.36, sigma), 3);` `r p1-p2`$

- Let $X$ be a normal random variable with mean $\mu$ and standard deviation $\sigma$, that is $X\sim \mathcal{N}(\mu, \sigma^2)$. In Excel, $P(X<x)$ is given by `NORM.DIST(x, mean, sd, TRUE)`.
