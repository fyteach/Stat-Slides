## Learning Goals {.unnumbered}

- Create and interpret graphs (dot plots, histograms, pie charts, bar charts) as a means of summarizing and communicating data meaningfully.

- Identify the shape of a distribution (right-skewed, left-skewed, symmetric, or uniform).

---

## Distribution of Numerical Data

- In data analysis, one goal is to describe **patterns** (known as the **distribution**) of the variable in the data set and create a useful summary about the set.
- To describe patterns in data, we use descriptions of **shape**, **center**,
and **spread**. We also describe exceptions to the pattern. We call these exceptions **outliers**.

:::
::: {.remark style="margin-top: -1em"}
The center of a distribution may refer to the mean, the weight balancing point; the median, the 50/50 breaking points; or a mode, a peak. For a geometric explanation, see [Mean, Median and Mode in Distributions: Geometric Aspects](https://openpress.usask.ca/introtoappliedstatsforpsych/chapter/3-1-central-tendency-mean-median-mode/)

## Dot Plots

A **dot plot** includes all values from the data set, with one dot for each occurrence of an observed value from the set.

**How to Construct**

1. Draw a horizontal line and mark it with an appropriate measurement scale.
2. Locate each value in the data set along the measurement scale, and represent it by a dot. Stack the dots vertically if the value appear multiple times.

---

## Example: Petal Lengths of Iris Flower

The data set contains 15 petal lengths of iris flower. Create a dot plot to describe the distribution of petal lengths.

::: {.center}
```{r echo=FALSE, results = 'asis'} 
cat(paste(head(iris$Petal.Length,15), collapse=", "))
```
:::

**Solution:** For each number in the data set, we draw a dot. We stack dots of the same value from bottom to up.

::: {.center}
```{r echo=FALSE, results = 'asis', fig.width=6, fig.asp=0.5} 
# use the preloaded iris package in R
irisdot <- head(iris["Petal.Length"],15)
# find the max frequency (used `plyr` package)
yheightPL <- max(plyr::count(irisdot, vars = "Petal.Length"))
# basic dotplot (binwidth = the accuracy of the data)
dotchart = ggplot(irisdot, aes(x=Petal.Length), dpi = 600)
dotchart = dotchart + geom_dotplot(binwidth=0.1, method="histodot", dotsize = 0.6, fill="blue")
# dotchart = dotchart + stat_density(aes(y=0.1/7*..count..), geom="line", colour="red", linetype="dashed", size=1,adjust=1.2)
# use coor_fixed(ration=binwidth*dotsize*max frequency) to setup the right y axis height.
dotchart = dotchart + theme_bw() + coord_fixed(ratio=0.1*0.6*yheightPL)
# tweak the theme a little bit
dotchart = dotchart + theme(panel.background=element_blank(),
                            panel.border = element_blank(),
                            panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),
                            # plot.margin=unit(c(-4,0,-4,0), "cm"),
                            axis.line = element_line(colour = "black"),
                            axis.line.y = element_blank(),
)
# add more tick mark on x axis
dotchart = dotchart + scale_x_continuous(breaks = seq(1,1.8,0.1))
# add tick mark on y axis to reflect frequencies. Note yheightPL is max frequency.
dotchart = dotchart + scale_y_continuous(limits=c(0, 1), expand = c(0, 0), breaks = seq(0, 1,1/yheightPL), labels=seq(0,yheightPL))
# remove x y lables and remove vertical grid lines
dotchart = dotchart + labs(x=NULL, y=NULL) + removeGridX()
dotchart

## Histograms (1 of 2)

- Histograms are frequently used to describe large sets of numerical data, in particular, data of a continuous variable.

- A **histogram** consists of a horizontal axis, a vertical axis and adjoining vertical bars. The horizontal axis is labeled to break data values into **bins (classes)**. The vertical axis is then scaled accordingly so that the area of a bar is the frequency or the relative frequency of values in the bin.

- To construct a histogram, we need to decide boundary of bars which forms intervals, called **bins or classes** and find the **frequency** of values in each bin.

- A **frequency distribution** is a table which contains bins, frequencies and **relative frequencies** which are proportions (percentage) defined by the formula $\text{Relative frequency} =\dfrac{\text{Class frequency}}{\text{Sample size}}$.

---

## Histograms (2 of 2)

- The lower boundary of a bin is called a **lower bin limit**. The upper boundary of a bin is called an **upper bin limit**.
  
- The **bin width** is the distance between the lower (or upper) bin limits of two consecutive bins.

- The difference between the maximum and the minimum data entries is called the **range**.

- The range is roughly, indeed slightly smaller than, $\text{number of bins}\times \text{bin width}$.
  
- The **midpoint** of a bin is the half of the sum of the lower and upper limits of the bin.

- Bin limits should be chosen so that each value of the data is in exactly one bin.

---

## Conventions on Constructing Bins

- For a continuous variable: take an appropriate bin width, take the first lower bin as the minimum, and then take left closed and right opened intervals as bins.
- For a discrete variable: take an appropriate bin width and take the first lower bin limit to be a value slightly smaller than the minimum minus of the data set.
- Excel convention (roughly): take left opened and right closed intervals.

::: {.remark}

1. Histograms are usually used for continuous data. For discrete numerical variables, the using of a bar chart or a histogram depends on context.
2. The choice of bin width (or the number of bins) has a more significant impact on the histogram than the method used to determine bin limits.
3. It's often helpful to visualize the data using different binning strategies.
<!-- 4. There are also different conventions to determine the number of bins or bin width. -->

## Example: Histogram of mpg (1 of 3)

The following data set show the mpg (mile per gallon) of $`r SampleSize<-30; SampleSize`$ cars.  Construct a frequency table and frequency histogram for the data set using $`r Nbins<-ceiling(2*SampleSize^(1/3)); Nbins`$ bins. What can be concluded from the histogram?

::: {.center}

```{r echo=FALSE, results = 'asis'}
cars <- head(mtcars$mpg,SampleSize)
cat(paste(cars, collapse=", "))
```

:::

**Solution:**

- Find the range using $\text{Range}=\text{maximum}-\text{minimum}$. Here, the minimum is $`r sm<-min(cars); sm`$, the maximum is $`r lg<-max(cars); lg`$, and the range is $`r lg`-`r sm`=`r rg<-lg-sm; rg`$.
- For $k$ bins, the bin width can be taken between $\frac{\mathrm{range}}{k}$ and $\frac{\mathrm{range}}{k-1}$. Here, we take the bin width as $`r Bwidth<-ceiling(10*rg/Nbins)/10; Bwidth`$ which is between $\frac{`r rg`}{`r Nbins`}\approx `r round(rg/Nbins, 3)`$ and $\frac{`r rg`}{`r Nbins`-1}\approx `r round(rg/(Nbins-1), 3)`$.
- Take the first lower bin limit as the minimum $`r sm`$. Add the bin width $`r Bwidth`$ recursively to get all lower bin limits: `r lowerbins<- sm+Bwidth*c(0:(Nbins-1)); lowerbins`.

---

## Example: Histogram of mpg (2 of 3)
<!-- 
**Solution:**(continued) -->
- The upper limits can be taken as `r upperbins<-lowerbins+Bwidth; upperbins`.

## Example: Histogram of mpg (3 of 3)

The following information can be obtained from the histogram.

- The histogram has a single peak within the interval 13.8 and 20.6.

- Majority of cars in the sample has mpg lower than 20.6.

- The mean mpg is around 20.6.

- The range of the mpg is between 13.8 and 34.2.

- The right tail is longer.

---

## Some Remarks on Histogram (1 of 2)

- There should be *no space* between any two bars.

- The area of a bar represents the relative frequency for the bin. Equivalently,
  $$\text{area of bar} = \text{relative frequency} = \text{height of bar (density)}\times \text{bar width}.$$

- The vertical axis is called the density scale.

- For continuous variables, unequal bin width may also be used.

---

## Some Remarks on Histogram (2 of 2)

- One convention about the bin width for $k$ bins is to choose a number with the same or one more decimal place that is greater than $\frac{\text{range}}{k}$, but no more than $\frac{\text{range}}{k-1}$ as the bin width.

- To determine the number of bins, there are practical rules. For example, the Rice rule takes the bin number $k$ as the **round up of $n^{1 / 3}$**. The webpage [Statistic How To](https://www.statisticshowto.com/choose-bin-sizes-statistics/) has more information.

- The convenient starting point can be a value smaller but not too much smaller than the minimum.

- The bin width can significantly affect the shape of the histogram. It is better to experiment with different choices.

## Practice: Petal Lengths of Irises {.unnumbered}

The following data set show the petal length of 20 irises. Construct a frequency table and frequency histogram for the data set using `r ceiling(2*20^(1/3))` bins. What can you conclude from the histogram?

::: {.center}
```{r echo=FALSE, results = 'asis'} 
irispetal <- sample(iris$Petal.Length,20)
cat(paste(irispetal, collapse=", "))
```
:::

---

## Stem-and-Leaf Plots

A stem-and-leaf plot is a kind of histogram that lets you see all your data instead of just class frequency information. The leading digit(s) form stems and the "tailing digits" form leaves.

**How to Construct**

- Select one or more leading digits for the stem values. The trailing digits become the leaves. **Trailing digits for the same stem may further break into two leaves, lower or higher.**
- List possible stem values in a vertical column.
- Record the leaf for every observation beside the corresponding stem value.
- Indicate the units for stems and leaves someplace in the display.

---

## Example: Heights of Cherry Trees

Consider the following data of heights of 15 cherry trees. Create a stem-and-leaf plot and describe the distribution.

::: {.center}
```{r echo=FALSE, results = 'asis'}
cherrytrees <- sample(trees$Height,15)
cat(paste(sort(cherrytrees), collapse=", "))
```
:::

**Solution:**

:::: {style="display: flex; align-items: center; justify-content: center;"}

```{r stem1, echo=FALSE, comment=NA}
out1 <- capture.output(stem(cherrytrees, scale = 0.5))
stemout1 <- paste(out1[nzchar(out1)], collapse="\n")
cat(stemout1, sep="\n")
```

## Common Descriptions of Shape Distribution

- **Right skewed** (or reverse $J$-shaped): A right-skewed distribution has a lot of data at lower variable values.

- **Left skewed** (or $J$-shaped): A left skewed distribution has a lot of data at higher variable values with smaller amounts of data at lower variable values.

- **Symmetric with a central peak (or bell-shaped)**: A central peak with a tail in both directions. A bell-shaped distribution has a lot of data in the center with smaller amounts of data tapering off in each direction.

- **Uniform**: A rectangular shape, the same amount of data for each variable value.

- For examples of left skewed and uniform distributions, please see the example in [Dotplot 2 of 2 in Concepts in Statistics](https://courses.lumenlearning.com/wmopen-concepts-statistics/chapter/dotplots-2-of-2/)

## Practice: Shapes of Distributions {.unnumbered}

Statistics are used to compare and sometimes identify authors. The following lists shows a simple random sample that compares the letter counts for three authors.

Terry: 7, 9, 3, 3, 3, 4, 1, 3, 2, 2

Davis: 3, 4, 4, 4, 1, 4, 5, 2, 3, 1

Maris: 2, 3, 4, 4, 4, 6, 6, 6, 8, 3

Create a dot plot for each sample and describe the shape of the distribution of each sample.

## Centers of a Data Set

- **Mean**: The mean is the average, this is the quotient of the total sum by the total number.
- **Median**: The median is a value that separates the data set into the lower half set and the upper half set.
- **Mode**: The mode is the data value that has the most occurrence in the data set.

::: {.remark}

- When the distribution is **approximately symmetric** with a single central peak, the *mean* is usually used to measure the center. The *median* is used as a measure of center for all *other cases*.
- Before analyzing the center, it's better to graph the data and determine the shape of the distribution.

## Frequency Distribution for Categorical Data

- A **frequency distribution for categorical data** is a table that displays the possible categories along with the associated frequencies and/or relative frequencies.

- The **frequency** of a category is the number of occurrences of elements in the category.

- The proportion of a frequency to the size of the population or the sample is also called the **relative frequency**.

- A **relative frequency distribution** is a frequency distribution that includes relative frequencies.

---

## Visualization of Categorical Data

- A **bar chart** consists of bars (rectangles), each represent a category and the area of each bar is constantly proportional to the relative frequency of that category.

- A **pie chart** is a pie with sectors represents categories and the area of each sector is proportional to the relative frequency of that category.

- **Stacked bar char** (segmented bar chart) is a bar divided into segments, with each segment representing a category and the area of the segment is proportional to the relative frequency for that category.

## Frequency Tables

In Excel, to create a frequency table for a data array, we need a bin array. The values in a bin array in Excel are the first $k-1$ upper bin limits. For example, if the bin array consists of 30, 40, and 50, then the bins will be $[\text{min},30]$, $(30,40]$, $(40, 50]$, $(50, \infty)$.

With a data array and a bin array, the Excel function `FREQUENCY(data_array, bins_array)` can be used to create a frequency table.

Suppose the data set is in `column A` and the bin array is in `column B`.

1. In `column C`, select a column array of $k$ cells, then enter `=FEQUENCY(`
2. select the data values
3. in the formula bar, enter the symbol comma `,`
4. select the bin array
5. in the formula bar, enter `)`.

Hit `Enter` (`Ctrl + Shift + Enter` in older versions), you will get a frequency table.

---

## Charts in Excel

Excel has many built-in chart functions. To create a charts, 

1. Select the data array/table
2. Under the `Insert` tab, click on an appropriate chart in the `Charts` command set.

The appearance of chart can be changed after being created.

---

## Histogram (1 of 2)

1. Select the data

2. On the `Insert` tab, in the `Charts` group, from the `Insert Statistic Chart` dropdown list, select `Histogram`:

   **Note:** The histogram contains a special first bin which always contains the smallest number. This is different from many textbooks.

To **format the histogram chart** is similar to format a Pie chart. For example, you can change bin width from `Format Axis`.

1. Right-click on the horizontal axis and choose `Format Axis` in the popup menu:

2. In the `Format Axis` pane, on the `Axis Options` tab, you may try different options for bins. 

---

## Histogram (2 of 2)

::: {.remark}

- Excel using a different convention to create histogram. The first bin is a closed interval and other bins are left open and right closed intervals.

- Select the **Overflow bin** checkbox and type the number, all values above this number will be added to the last bin.

- Select the **Underflow bin** checkbox and type the number, all values below and equal to this number will be added to the first bin.

- Histograms show the shape and the spread of numerical data. For categorical data, discrete by its definition, bar charts are usually used to represent category frequencies.

:::

---

## The `Analysis ToolPak`

Suppose your data set is in `Column A` in Excel.

- In the cell `B1`, put the *first lower bin limit*, which is a number slightly less than the minimum but has more decimal places than the data set.

- Create upper bin limits in column C.

- In Data menu, look for the Data Analysis ToolPak (if not, go to File > Options > Add-ins > Manage Excel Add-ins, check Analysis ToolPak). In the popup windows, find Histogram.

- In the input range, select your data set. In the bin range, select upper bins.

- Check Chart Output and hit OK. You will see the frequency table and histogram in Sheet 2.

- Change the gap between bars. Right-click a bar and choose `Format Data Series...` and change the `Gap Width` to 2% or 1%.

---

## Dotplot

- If you have a raw data set, follow the same procedure a creating a histogram but with a bin width equal the same accuracy of the data. For example, if you data set consists of integers, then choose 1 as the bin-width.

- Change the format of bars in the histogram.

  - Right click a bar and select `Format Data Series...`.
  
  - Find `Fill & Line` and select both `Picture or texture fill` and `Stack and Scale with`.
  
  - Click the button `Oneline...` and input *dot* in `search bing` and hit enter.
  
  - Select a picture you like, and you will get a dot-plot.
